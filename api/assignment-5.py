# Choose an API from the resource called 'A list of a TON of FREE API's' from the last video. 
# Pick at least 5 different pieces of information from the json response.
# Create a text interface that will make requests based on user input.
# NOTE: You will need to research how to handle a response that comes from a user searching or trying to search for something that does not exist. 
# 200 is success, what is the response code of an unsuccessful query? 
# Use an if statement to sort this out and allow the user to try again.
